										<h2>My professional focus</h2>
									</header>
									<p>My professional approach is centered around two therapies: Systemic Family Therapy and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.</p>
									<p>I have developed Systemic Family Therapy approach during my practice in Germany and Lithuania.<br/>In Germany, I had an honor working alongside the (at that time) president of European Family Therapy Association – Maria Borcsa, with whom I also developed and presented a project in the 5<sup>th</sup> International Conference Qualitative Research on Mental Health (QRMH5).<br/>With my focus on Systemic Family Therapy  I also did a practice at Family Psychology Center (in Lithuania).<br/>Finally, every year I teach about Genograms (a method of family tree analysis) to university students in Germany, where we deeply discuss the theory and practice of Bowen’s Family Systems Theory. Through all these and other professional developments, the view of family and other social structures as a system has become a big part of my present focus and is seen throughout my work.</p>
									<p>My Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) discoveries started in The Netherlands. I’ve gained Msc. in Clinical Psychology, in which CBT was the biggest focus of the studies (as it is one of the most evidence-based therapy approaches nowadays). With all this knowledge, I have incorporated it in my work, especially when it comes to the area of mindset and negative thoughts.</p>
									<p>Last but not least, I have dipped my nose into Nonviolent Communication approach (by Marshal Rosenberg) when I have prepared a training about it for my colleagues in the Psychology Family Center. This approach of a direct, self-responsible and blameless language is simple, yet healing way to communicate with your partner and others around you. I turn to this approach when the person has difficulty expressing themselves to others in a clam and clear way.</p>

									<h3>What do these approaches mean in terms of my services?</h3>
									<p>Starting with Systemic Family Therapy, it means that I always look back at your background, your culture, your family. Who we are today is strongly determined by the environment we grew up in. Looking back to the family is essential to understand yourself today, to see which pieces of puzzle makes you. BUT, it is not a goal of blaming or regret, it is a way to understand your family’s history, their own difficulties and future goals you need to achieve. Most importantly, knowing the influences from your environment, helps you to step back and re-evaluate your own believes, values, and choices. It is the most conscious action, when you, an independent individual, can make the choice of who you want to be. I call it “cleaning your wardrobe”.</p>
									<p>Besides, or, alongside your family, is your mindset (that’s where the Cognitive Behavioural Therapy jumps in). While your mindset is greatly influenced by your past experiences, it also controls your present, which is the time you’re struggling. Your negative thoughts about yourself, your believes about yourself and others, are not only driving your emotions, but also everyday behaviors. Thus, we analyse your everyday thoughts, feelings and behaviors, try to evaluate them rationally and change towards the ones that helps you go forward and feel better.</p>
									<p>When it comes to communicating with others, learning to hold responsible for your feelings and expressing your needs is the main skill I teach (i.e. following nonviolent communication approach). With your partner (family) as well as other social circle, I help you learn to express your negative emotions without blame and accept them from others without guilt. In this way, everyone can stay true to themselves and get closer to each other.</p>
