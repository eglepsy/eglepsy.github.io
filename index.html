												<p>In the group, we talk openly about our lives. We put difficulties on the table, turn on self-reflection and help others by sharing our own experiences. It’s a power of sharing, when you feel understood by talking and learn by listening. Real feelings, serious discussions, no feeling of wrongness. </p>
