											  <h4>Individual counseling</h4>
											  <p>Feeling constantly sad, unmotivated to do anything? Or having anger outbursts? Other feeling that is not going away and is affecting your quality of life? Then, let me help you reduce it, figure out the source and ways to control it.</p>
											  <p>During individual sessions we discuss your personal challenges, find underlying issues and ways to deal with them. </p>

											  <h4>Couple counseling</h4>
											  <p>Are you two struggling to feel heard and understood by each other? Are you dealing with cultural differences or feeling not synced-in?</p>
											  <p>During couple’s sessions we discuss your relationship dynamic. We learn to see and apply your communication and behavior in a circular (not cause-effect) way, where you both equally contribute to your relationship’s growth and tensions. You learn to solve the rising difficulties together, openly expressing and listening to each other. </p>

											  <h4>Expat Women Support Group</h4>
												<p>Are you feeling alone in your struggles? Don’t have a social circle to feel understood and a place to openly express your emotions?</p>
												<p>In the group, we talk openly about our lives. We put difficulties on the table, turn on self-reflection and help others by sharing our own experiences. It’s a power of sharing, when you feel understood by talking and learn by listening. Real feelings, serious discussions, no feeling of wrongness. </p>

I have gained my B.Sc. in Psychology in the top 10 oldest universities in Europe (Vilnius University) and finished MSc. with honors in Clinical and Health Psychology in the best university of the Netherlands (Utrecht University).
                                                                        Also, I have completed exchange studies and professional practice in Lithuania, Germany, Italy and, finally, The Netherlands.</p>
                                                                        <p>My professional approach is centered around Systemic Family Therapy and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, which ideally fits in adjusting maladaptive mindsets and relationships in crisis—what is so common in the expat life (read more in <a href="professional.html">my professional focus</a>).</p>
                                                                        <p>Living in all these countries and having constant international interactions made me deeply familiar with expat problems not only through professional, but also personal level. I breath expat experience—that’s how much I know it!</p>
